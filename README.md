# learning DSA

This repo is just to track my journey of learning various data structures in algorithms,
primarily in C++ but also occasionally in python.

## plan

### algorithms
1. binary search
2. binary tree traversals
3. sorting
4. BFS
5. DFS

### structures
1. dynamic arrays
2. linked lists
3. stacks
4. queues
5. binary trees
6. hashmaps/sets
7. heaps
8. graphs
